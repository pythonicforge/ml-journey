## Overview

Welcome to **ML Journey** â€“ a collection of all mini-projects and tutorials in Data Science and Machine Learning. This repository serves as a personal learning space where I document and share everything I learn about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

- **Tutorials**: Contains various tutorials that I have followed or created to understand different concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning.
- **Projects**: Includes mini-projects that I have worked on to apply the concepts learned.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the tutorials and projects. Each section is designed to be self-contained, providing all the necessary information and resources to understand and replicate the work.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily a personal learning space, contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions for improvements or new tutorials/projects, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

## Blog

I also write blogs about my learning journey. You can check them out [here](https://pythonicforge.github.io/blog/).
